<h1 class="cow-heading">Maker Culture meets Art</h1>

<p>There is a new conjunction emerging around open hardware, maker culture, and
art. Remember how pop culture changed with the advent of punk in the late
seventies? We seem to be witnessing a similar explosion of 'garageband'
creativity in the tennies, and the Pi is proudly leading the charge for
general purpose open source devices<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote1"><sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span> in this
context. (The Pi foundation even has an <em>artist in residence</em> &mdash;
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/4329">Rachel Rayns</a>.)</p>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_hardware_projects">Open-source hardware</a> allows people to make their own robots, cameras, or even
electrocardiagraph machines by downloading schematics and incorporating any
changes they need &mdash; and, typically, free open-source software is available to
run these projects. 3D printers, laser cutters and CNC routers have helped
this adoption of the open-everything ethos<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote2"><sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>.</p>

<p>There are stacks of DIY projects based on the Raspberry Pi, and the flood
showns no sign of slowing. The Pi is the first general purpose device (in
contrast to the magnificent but more specialised Arduino) which is very easy
to cobble together with add-on electronics. The thriving community that has
grown up around the Pi (including this magazine) is making a huge impact, from
changes in the <a class="cow-url" href="http://pi.gate.ac.uk/pages/schools.html">UK schools
curriculum</a> to <a class="cow-url" href="http://learn.adafruit.com/onion-pi/">the Onion Pi
anti-surveillance</a> device, to <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.dexterindustries.com/BrickPi/">BrickPi's</a> new brains for old lego Robots.</p>

<p>This article describes the <a class="cow-url" href="http://pi.gate.ac.uk/pages/pibrush.html">PiBrush</a>, a simple on-screen painting system that uses the
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.piborg.com/xloborg">XLoBorg</a> motion and direction sensor add-on
board from <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.piborg.com/">PiBorg</a>. The XLoBorg adds an
accelerometer and a magnetometer (compass) to your Pi and makes all sorts of
motion-based interaction possible &mdash; like a
<a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect">Kinect</a> but free and open. Here's a
PiBrush picture:</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="images/pi-brush-snap.jpg" alt="Pi Brush snapshot" width="500"></p>

<p>The PiBrush is an interactive art and technology exhibit (a rather grand name
for something so small!) that simulates flicking paint off the end of a
paintbrush onto canvas &mdash; as <a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock">Jackson Pollock</a> famously did in the 1940s and 50s. It utilizes two Raspberry
Pis (one Model B and one Model A), one <a class="cow-url" href="http://piborg.org/xloborg/">XLoBorg</a>,
a battery pack, a display, and two Wi-Fi dongles. The Model A is held by the
user and waved around. It collects acceleration data with the XLoBorg, which
it then transmits via ad hoc Wi-Fi to the Model B, which processes the data
collected into paint droplets and displays them on the screen, connected via
HDMI. Functionally it looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="images/pibrush/pibrush_architecture.png" alt="Pi Brush snapshot" width="500"></p>

<p>And here's the hardware (we may improve on the elastic band in future models
:-)). The model A (client):</p>

<!--% %[-->

<!--% %]-->


<p><img class="cow-img" src="images/pibrush/modela.jpg" alt="Model A" width="500"></p>

<p>And the model B (server):</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="images/pibrush/modelb.jpg" alt="Model B" width="500"></p>

<p>(The red button on the server saves the picture and starts another.)</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="programming"></a></p><h1 class="cow-heading">The Code</h1>

<p>The hardware for this project is fairly straightforward. The XLoBorg plugs
directly into the GPIO pins as a block on the client, and a push button simply
connects a ground and GPIO pin on the server. The software is where the
challenge lies: intermediate to advanced code to write, using Python and some
basic physics. </p>

<p>The code is available on
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/tree/master/pibrush/bin">GitHub</a> and as a <a class="cow-url" href="http://pi.gate.ac.uk/pages/package.html">Rasbian package in
an Ubuntu PPA</a>. The core is in <b>accel<span class="cow-escape">_</span>client.py</b> which runs on the Model A
and <b>accel<span class="cow-escape">_</span>server.py</b> which runs on the Model B. The former reads from the
sensor and sends data across the network; the latter processes the data and
displays the output on the screen.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="accel_server"></a></p><h2 class="cow-heading">accel<span class="cow-escape">_</span>server.py</h2>

<p>The server script is the meat of the programming is as it handles the physics
simulation and display. First, as we're dealing with sensor input we want to
use something called a <em>moving average</em> to store accelerometer readings, which
is initialised like this:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums">
# length of moving average array
AL = 20

# accelerometer storage for moving average
AXa = numpy.zeros((AL, 1))
AYa = numpy.zeros((AL, 1))
AZa = numpy.ones((AL, 1))

# array index for accelerometer data
Ai = 0
</pre>A moving average is the average of, in this case, the last 20 readings. Some
sort of filtering is almost always necessary when dealing with the sort of
analog input data that comes from an acceleromter to prevent sudden jumps in
the readings from having an undue impact on the processing. A moving average
is a convenient and easy way to do it. We simply input the current reading at
index <b>Ai</b> and then increment Ai until it exceeds <b>AL</b>, then wrap it back
around:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums">
        AXa[Ai] = float(a[0])
        AYa[Ai] = float(a[1])
        AZa[Ai] = float(a[2])
        Ai = Ai + 1
        if Ai == AL:
            Ai = 0
</pre>(Here <b>a</b> is an array of the acclerometer data as read over the network.) I've
used <b>numpy</b> because it executes more quickly than standard Python lists, and
there are convenient functions to make things simpler like <b>.ones()</b> to
initialze all of <b>AZa</b> to a value of one &mdash; we assume a starting 1G of gravity
downwards.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="functions"></a></p><h3 class="cow-heading">Functions</h3>

<p>If you don't know, a function is a bit of code written in such a way that it
can be executed from different places in the main program. Each <em>call</em> you can
pass different <em>arguments</em> (input parameters) that will be operated on and a
new result <em>returned</em>. There are two quite important functions used in the
code that have to do with
<a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system"><em>polar coordinates</em></a>.
If you know X, Y, Z, those are 
<a class="cow-url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"><em>Cartesian
coordinates</em></a>.</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums">
def polar(X, Y, Z):
    x = numpy.linalg.norm([X, Y, Z])
    if (x &gt; 0):
        y = -math.atan2(Z, X)
        z = math.asin(Y / x)
    else:
        y = 0
        z = 0
    return (x, y, z)
</pre>Here <b>polar</b> takes a Cartesian X, Y, and Z coordinate and returns the
equivalent polar coordinates, where x is R, is the radius to the point from
the origin, and y is A and z is B. The latter are the angular rotation about
the Z and Y axis. Because the Model A may be rotated relative to the screen,
we need a convenient mechanism for rotating the acceleration vectors recorded
to ones we can use on the screen. In order to do that though we need to
subtract the Earth's gravitational field. This is what the polar coordinates
are used for. It's an extension of the regular
<a class="cow-url" href="http://hotmath.com/hotmath_help/topics/adding-and-subtracting-vectors.html">subtraction of vectors</a>. This function was based on
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.processing.org/discourse/beta/num_1236393966.html">this</a> forum
thread.</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums">
def cartesian(X, A, B):
    x = 0 # don't bother - isn't used
    y = X * math.sin(B) * math.sin(A)
    z = X * math.cos(B)
    return (x, y, z)
</pre>Here <b>cartesian</b> as you might suspect does the opposite of polar, taking the
distance X and rotations A and B and turns them back into Cartesian
coordinates. As this code is only used as part of getting coordinates ready
for the screen, x, as the coordinate into the screen, is permanently set to 0.
This is an optimization to help the code run better on the Pi. The code here
is based on <a class="cow-url" href="http://electron9.phys.utk.edu/vectors/3dcoordinates.htm">this</a>
explanation of Cartesian and polar coordinates.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="mainprogram"></a></p><h3 class="cow-heading">Main program</h3>

<p>The main program consists of an infinitely repeating loop that reads the
accelerometer data over the network, applies the earlier moving average, and
then processes it.</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums">
    # move time forward
    dt = time.time() - last_time
    last_time = time.time()
</pre>The first thing to be done each loop is to move time forwards. Ideally
execution time for each loop is identical and <b>dt</b> (the timestep) is constant.
However, this isn't the case, so by knowing how long it's been since the last
loop we can know how far to move things, i.e., distance = velocity <span class="cow-escape">*</span> time.</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums">
        # moving averages for acceleration
        AX = numpy.sum(AXa) / AL
        AY = numpy.sum(AYa) / AL
        AZ = numpy.sum(AZa) / AL

        # combined acceleration for
        # working out resting gravity
        A = math.fabs(numpy.linalg.norm([AX,
                AY, AZ]) - 1)
</pre>After reading in the accelerometer data and putting it in the <b>AXa</b>, etc.,
arrays, we then need to take the average of that array. <b>.sum()</b> adds up the
values in an array and then to do an average we divide by the number of
elements <b>AL</b> and so <b>AX</b>, etc., has the moving average.</p>

<p>The total combined acceleration <b>A</b> is worked out by calculating the
<a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance">Euclidean distance</a>
from 0 to the acceleration vector position using <b>linalg.norm()</b>.
At rest this should work out to just about 1 (remember we're working in
acceleration in G(ravities), which is why we subtract 1. We then use
<a class="cow-url" href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html#math.fabs"><b>.fabs()</b></a> so that we
always have a positive result which indicates the difference between
acceleration due to gravity and the experienced acceleration. At rest this
number should be very small.</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums">
        # in a slow moment store most recent 
        # direction of the gravitational field
        if A &lt; 0.02 and (last_time - last_G) &gt; 0.12:
            GX = AX
            GY = AY
            GZ = AZ
            (PGR, PGA, PGB) = polar(GX, GY, GZ)
            last_G = last_time

        # rotate to screen coordinates
        # and subtract gravity
        (PAR, PAA, PAB) = polar(AX, AY, AZ)
        (GAX, GAY, GAZ) = cartesian(PAR,
                PAA - PGA + PSGA, PAB - PGB + PSGB)
        GAZ = GAZ - PGR
</pre>Now that we know something about gravity and the current acceleration, we can
act on it. I've pointed out how in order to know which way the Model A is
moving, we need to know where gravity is first. We can't know it exactly, but
we can estimate it. As <b>A</b> is the acceleration the Model A is experiencing
<em>excluding gravity</em>, it's very low when the Model A isn't moving at all. This
means that the only acceleration being experienced is due to gravity and so we
can take the estimate and then turn it into polar coordinates. (Provided we
haven't just done all of this.)</p>

<p>For every loop we need to actually do the gravity subtraction and rotation for
the screen. We turn the current acceleration into polar coordinates and then on
the next line turn them back into cartesian coordinates while subtracting the
estimated rotation of the gravitational field. The <b>GAZ</b> line after than
subtracts gravity from its absolute direction. (This is a bad explanation and
to be honest I'm not entirely sure why this works, but it does!)</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="paintbrushphysics"></a></p><h3 class="cow-heading">Paintbrush physics</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting bit of what's going on every loop: the paint brush
physics. This is the code that controls what happens on the screen. Everything
up to this point has been to get us <b>GAY</b> and <b>GAZ</b>, two variables indicating
horizontal and vertical acceleration relative to the screen. Now we get to
interpret it and make something <em>happen</em>.</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums">
    # acceleration detection for paint strokes
    A = numpy.linalg.norm([GAY, GAZ])
</pre>After this, <b>A</b> is the total acceleration of the Model A, with respect to the
screen, ignoring gravity. This is useful. We can use this number to detect
roughly if we're speeding up or slowing down. What happens after that?</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums">
    if fast == 1:
        # accelerate the paint brush
        VX = VX - GAY * dt * 170
        VY = VY - GAZ * dt * 170
        BX = BX + VX * dt * 120
        BY = BY + VY * dt * 120
</pre>This bit of code is actually responsible for moving the brush, and only when we
think it's moving. This is where something called <em>twice integration</em> comes in.
Imagine you're in a car traveling down the motorway at 100 kph. In one hour
you will have travelled 100 km. Easy? That's simple integration, going from
velocity to displacement. Acceleration though, is the rate of change in
velocity, e.g. the speed at which the needle of the speedometer in the car
climbs. So now imagine accelerating at 1 kph per second, after 10 seconds
you'll be going 10 kph faster, so instead of 100 kph you're now going 110 kph.
Apply that to the distance you've travelled and you have twice integration.
(Fun fact: if you kept up that acceleration, after an hour you'd be going 3,700
kph and would have traveled 36,370 km. Or almost around the Earth.)</p>

<p>Similarly, we increment the brush velocity by the acceleration, factored by the
timestep to keep the animation smooth. I've also added a factor of <b>170</b> to
scale up the acceleration so it displays nicely on the screen. (This is sort of
like saying that 1 pixel represents 170 meters.) The next integration is
incrementing the brush position by adding on the current velocity, also
factored by the timestep and scaled, this time by <b>120</b>. (These values just
work, but are physically nonsense.)</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums">
        # add splotches.... high velocity big 
        # splotches far apart, low small close
        if P &gt; 0:
            V = numpy.linalg.norm([VX, VY])
            S = S + V
            d = A * random.randint(3, 5) * 25 + V
</pre>Now that the paintbrush is moving, comes the last most important bit of code:
making paint droplets. This bit of code is only run while the paintbrush is
moving and only if there's paint on the brush. Vaguely you expect that the
further the brush has been swung the more paint I expect to come off and the
faster it's going the more paint to come off. <b>V</b> is calculated as the total
velocity, and <b>S</b> is a running displacement. <b>d</b> is calculated as a rough
estimtate of paint droplet spacing.</p>

<p>Paint droplets (probably) fly off due to two factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="cow-url" href="http://www.mne.psu.edu/cimbala/Learning/Fluid/Introductory/what_is_fluid_mechanics.htm">Fluid mechanics</a>. Roughly, I'm speaking of the affect of what happens when
  you move a glass of water too quickly.</li>
<li><a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29">Air resistance</a>. The
  force you feel acting on your hand when you stick it out the car window on a
  drive on a nice summer's day.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these are rather complex subjects so I've sort of lumped them together
as the produce similar results &mdash; paint flying off the brush.
d is made up of A (our acceleration) times a random factor which is the fluid
dynamics bit, and V is added for the air resistance bit. The random factor
makes things a bit more interesting, perhaps taking into account things like
globs of paint or hairs in the brush getting tangled. <b>25</b> is the scaling factor
this time. (This applies to the acceleration term only as velocity was already
scaled before.)</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-python linenums">
            if S &gt; d:
                S = S - d
                P = P - pow(A*4, 2) * math.pi
                pygame.draw.circle(screen, (COLR, COLG, 
                        COLB), (int(BX), int(BY)), int(A*45))
                draw = 1
</pre>If we've travelled further than the expected paint droplet seperation according
to our, er, precise simulation, we need to draw a paint droplet! We calculate
the amount of paint that was in the droplet arbitrarily as the acceleration
times four, squared, times &pi; (pi). (Area of a circle formula.) This is
subtracted from <b>P</b>, the paint on the paintbrush variable. The paint droplet
actually drawn on the screen is done, assuming they're cricles, with the
Pygame function
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html#pygame.draw.circle"><b>draw.circle()</b></a>.
We're drawing on the screen, in our random color at the paintbrush position
(BX, BY). <b>A<span class="cow-escape">*</span>45</b> is the paint droplet radius, with 45 as another scaling
factor.</p>
