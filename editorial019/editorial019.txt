Welcome to issue 19 of The MagPi magazine.
This year has flown by and we are back with our Christmas issue once again!  Is Santa bringing you any Raspberry Pi goodies this Christmas?  If so we have plenty of great articles to help you put this clever computer straight to good use.
Are you bored by having your presents delivered by reindeer?  If you fancy a change, why not have your own Pi-powered quadcopter air drop them in?  Andy Baker begins his series on building this flying machine, covering in this issue the parts required, their function and discusses some of the coding used for lift off.... No it’s not powered by Christmas spirit.
If your too busy attending the works Christmas party and are missing your favourite soaps, never fear, we have you covered.  Geoff has produced a great article on OpenELEC, bringing you catch up TV on your Raspberry Pi so you never have to miss an episode again!  Claire Price continues the festive spirit, with a fantastic article on Sonic Pi which will have your Raspberry Pi singing along with a rendition of Good King Wenceslas.
Ihe news is currently filled with stories of electricity firms putting up their prices this winter.  If you want to be savvier with your heating and electricity bills without turning off the tree lights and turning the thermostat down, why not cast your eye over Pierre’s article on environmental monitoring.  Alternatively, to warm you up we return to Project Curacoa looking at the environmental subsystem used in this remote sensing project.
If that’s not enough to keep you busy in the holidays, why not paint an electronic masterpiece with XloBorg.  Andy Wilson looks at scrolling an RSS feed on an LCD via GPIO and ModMyPi continue their usual brilliance.  We revisit the Pi Store, keep you updated with events in your area and PC Supplies are yet again generously offering Raspberry Pi goodies in their monthly competition.
Merry Christmas and best wishes for 2014.
