First off thank you for all your hard work on The Magpi magazine. You guys are doing a fantastic job!

Thanks again for this brilliant resource.

I bought a Raspberry Pi a while ago, and other things got in the way of my plan for playing with it.  Now that winter is on the way and the evenings are drawing in, I have time to devote to returning to playing with my Raspberry Pi.  I have downloaded and read through some of the back issues of your magazine, and really like the format and contents.

Keep up the good work,
Robin


Great magazine, especially at the price!

As an electronics engineer with a bit of a background in programming,  I was amazed when I saw the Raspberry Pi launched at such a low price.

I am now spending all my spare time (which isn't that much) building bits and coding the Raspberry Pi.  Takes me back to the 80's, ZX80, Acorn Electron etc.

Your magazine is providing loads of info. for me, as well as ideas and enthusiasm.  
Sincere Thanks,
Nigel

My kids are very proud!

Many greetings,
